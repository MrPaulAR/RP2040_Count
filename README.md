# RP2040 Count

RP2040 Pixel Counter is a 'pocket' Pixel Counter. It uses a Waveshare RP2040-Tiny Development Board.  All the design files are open source and available on github.

To order PCBs upload the ["GERBER-RP2040_Count.zip"](https://github.com/computergeek1507/RP2040_Count/raw/main/PCB/jlcpcb/production_files/GERBER-RP2040_Count.zip) file in the "PCB\jlcpcb\production_files" folder to jlcpcb.com. Use the "BOM-RP2040_Count.csv" for the JLC Assembly BOM and "CPL-RP2040_Count.csv" as the footprint placement file.

## Assembly

The raw PCB's from JLC will be missing the RP2040-Tiny, OLED, Push Button and PigTails. These parts need to be soldered manually. The case is designed for flat pigtails.

Print the case out of PETG with 0.1mm layer height. Use #2-56 3/8" machine screws for case.
